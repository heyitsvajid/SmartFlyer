# SmartFlyer

  In this busy life no one really has time to wait hours at any point. This is one the main reasons why people prefer flying rather than by going by road, at least in domestic travel. But what is the use to fyling when a flyer has to wait hours in security line. But airport is a place where currently everyone has to go early and wait in the security line. We all hate waiting in line for airport security and it’s made even worse when you don’t expect it. The reason why this is happening is because there is no information about the wait times of security lines. Even if a person wants to plan his departure from home, the person is not able to do so due to lack of information. The issue we want to tackle is letting people know what kind of wait is awaiting them at the airport security check. It answers all the questions that come into a flyers mind like, what would be the wait time at a particular airport? What was the average wait time from past 6 hours ? What is the user trend, how much does an average user had to wait? How can I share my experience and help other flyers? How can I calculate the time I should leave home? All these questions would be answered by one simple and easy to use application known as ‘Smart Flyer’ So this android mobile application, that is easy to download and use and gives the information regarding security line wait times that a user wants to know.  With the help of ‘Smart Flyer’ application we can fight back by sharing wait time data and use other user-submitted data to estimate future waits. This will make it easier to plan the trip to airport and get through airport security screening. So no more waiting at the airports, going early, overcrowding the airport. A new era of easy and time saving flying awaits.  

## Objective
- Build an Android application, that will collect data from the users and calculate an average wait time for a specific airport. 
- Display an initial list of airports that are near to the users position.
- Allow a user to search for an airport he/she needs to go to.
- Display a details page where the user can get the airport details like address, wait time for the last six hours.
- The details page will also provide a form for the user to enter wait time.
- Allow the user to rate the application
- Allow the user to view a histogram of user trends and average wait times.

## Why SmartFlyer?
  There are currently applications in the market that suggest users how soon they should depart for the airport. All these apps have drawbacks or loopholes which we have  tried to fix in SmartFlyer. SmartFlyer doesn’t solely rely on data from TSA but also takes user input in the form of the amount of  time they waited in checkpoint queues. This will help ensure that our algorithm gets fed latest data. As for future development, the feed wait time feature can be extended to provide user incentives. Also, once user has cleared through check-in, security and immigration they might have time to grab a  quick bite or to do some last minute shopping. In that case, the application will show the user a map of airport terminal marked with restaurants, cafes et al, to spend time at.
